## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the corresponding ForgeHax Minecraft version (this is important if you want to run older versions of ezclient).
2. Download the latest ezclient build. Do NOT install the jar that ends with `-sources.jar`. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the ezclient jar into the `.minecraft/mods/` directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, you can place it under `.minecraft/mods/{mc.version}` where `mc.version` is the version of Minecraft running (ex: `.minecraft/mods/1.12.2`).
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. ezclient should now be loaded.
